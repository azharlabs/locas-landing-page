Locas is an open-source AI location orchestrator that helps users make smarter decisions about locations. Whether you're evaluating land for purchase, determining the viability of a business location, or analyzing environmental factors, Locas provides comprehensive insights through a unified interface.

## What is Locas?

At its core, Locas is a platform that coordinates multiple AI services, geospatial APIs, and environmental data sources to deliver location intelligence. It was created to democratize access to location-based insights that were previously only available to large enterprises with substantial resources.

## Key Features

Locas offers a wide range of features designed to help you understand locations in depth:
